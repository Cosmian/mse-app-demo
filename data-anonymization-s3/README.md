# Data Anonymization

## Create an anonymization config file

Your dataset must be a csv file with comma or semi-colon separator. Encoding must be UTF-8.

The configuration file (.json) is generated with [Cosmian Anonymization tool](https://hub.docker.com/r/cosmian/anonymization_ui).

Sample files are available in this repo:

- files/user_list.csv
- files/config_user_list.json

## Test locally
